                    At Hoock Trucking, we understand our drivers are our most important asset. Therefore, we have

                    experience, our driver trainers help teach our new team members what to expect at Hoock Trucking, and 
                    what is expected of them.

                          <p>James Smith started driving a semi-truck in 1999. He first started with us a driver to help William with delivering loads to the Midwest.
                              Since starting with Hoock Trucking, James has shown us his ability to keep safety and punctuality at the top of his mind.
                              This led to James becoming Hoock Trucking's first driver trainer.
